**Story**
One security guard made an observation.

I saw what i think was a woman around her mid 20s with a small dog in a crate in terminal 3. I later observed her in the customs without the dog and with a different bag. She looked nervous for the security check. She had light or blonde hair and i belive she was very tall. Somewhere between 175cm and 185cm.
