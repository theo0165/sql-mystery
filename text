- I saw a short old lady shouting at the staff in the in the security check because she wanted to take her cat on a plane. It all happend so fast and all of a sudden she was gone.

- When I was on my coffee break I saw on the security camera a man running from Starbucks. He was wearing I big backpack.

- I saw a man walking in to the toilets in terminal 3 holding carrying a large box. It looked suspicious because who brings moving boxes to the airport?
