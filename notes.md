One security guard made an observation.

I saw what i think was a woman around her mid 20s with a small dog in a crate in terminal 3. I later observed her in the customs without the dog and with a different bag. She looked nervous for the security check. She had light or blonde hair and i belive she was very tall. Somewhere between 175cm and 185cm.

Someone left a suspicious bag in the middle of the terminal at 10:23. Police has been called to check it out.

Big group of travelers at security checkpoint looking very nervous. When reading logs i could see that they checked in over 20 bags. Group consist of at least 10 people.

A man entered a bathroom in teminal 3 and came out looking nervous and suspicious. I walked past him and could see that his pupils where wide open. Possible drug usage. The man looked to be in his 20s with brown hair and green eyes. Black jacket and light wash jeans.
